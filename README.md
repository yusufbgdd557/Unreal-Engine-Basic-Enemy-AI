# Unreal-Engine-Basic-Enemy-AI

This project includes some basic enemy designs based on AI. There are 3 types of enemy mechanics.
First of them is an enemy who runs toward us once we entered it's sight.
The second mechanic is a stand-still enemy turret which follows our movement and turns around itself to shoot us.
And the third enemy is a patrol which can update itself location per 5 seconds and shoots us.
